#  RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program 
<div align="center">


</div>


Welcome to my journey of **SoC Tapeout Program **!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem

###  Key Learnings from Week 0
- In the first video we had overview about Modelling, Testbench, RTL Architect and overview about Physical Design Flow.
- Concluded the discussion with overview of peripherals.
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.
